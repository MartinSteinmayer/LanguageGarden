## General Principles

- **Clean Code:** Prioritize **readability, maintainability, and reusability**.
- **Conciseness:** Aim for concise and expressive code.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, components, and files (e.g., `getUserProfile`, `ProductCard`, `useAuth`).
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract reusable logic into functions, custom hooks, or components.
- **Modularization:** Break down complex problems and features into smaller, manageable units (components, functions, utilities).
- **TypeScript First:** All new code should be written in **TypeScript**, leveraging its type safety features.
- **Package Management:** This project uses **pnpm** for managing dependencies. All package installations and scripts should use `pnpm`.
- **Documentation:** All principal documentation should be created in the `docs` folder.

### General Guidelines

- **Separate UI, logic, and data fetching**
- **Typesafety across the whole stack â€“ db-server-client. If a type changes, everywhere using it should be aware.**
- **Design code such that it is easy to replace and delete**
- **Minimize places/number of changes to extend features**
- **Functions / APIs should do one thing well. One level of abstraction per function**
- **Minimize API interface and expose only what's necessary**
- **Favor pure functions, it makes logic easy to test**
- **Long, clear names over short, vague names, even at the cost of verbosity**
- **Make sure to always use the color palette specified in globals.css**
